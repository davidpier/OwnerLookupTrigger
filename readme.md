Custom Owner Lookup Trigger
============================================

Introduction
------------
This is a Trigger that keeps the standard OwnerId field in sync with a custom user lookup field.
The Standard Owner field doesn't allow you to access metadata on the user record, so a custom lookup field is necessary.

Contributions welcome.
